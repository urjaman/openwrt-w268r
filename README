Tenda W268R-related notes:
The system is very minimalized and doesnt follow normal
openwrt telnet + ssh system (with passwords),
so there's a few files (secrets) missing from the repo for a
functional image (atleast the host key and authorized keys):

package/base-files/files/etc/dropbear/authorized_keys
package/network/services/dropbear/files/dropbear_rsa_host_key
package/base-files/files/root/.ssh/id_dropbear
package/base-files/files/etc/config/wireless

also see
package/base-files/files/etc/config/network

It has a script to save files specified in 
/etc/cfg-saved-files (doesnt exist in image) to a 64k
mtd partition as cpio.gz for storing config
and a script thats run early on boot to restore them
(including the list of saved files that contains ref to itself).
If the WPS button is held during boot the restore is
skipped and the device has "factory" behaviour -
this is the only failsafe i have.

Updating FW is performed via script that uses scp 
to get the file from my pc and 
flashcp -v file /dev/mtd3 (IIRC, check yourself please)

Note on the role of the W268R for me (and the package selection):
- before the commit that added this message it was a WLAN AP/bridge-from-lan with minimal ebtables-based
 (manual script) filtering abilities for a guest wlan ap.
- after this commit it's a relayd pseudobridge (bridge wlan->lan), with manually configured udhcpd serving
the lan because relayd dhcp bridging seems not to work (unknown why).

This is the buildsystem for the OpenWrt Linux distribution.

Please use "make menuconfig" to configure your appreciated
configuration for the toolchain and firmware.

You need to have installed gcc, binutils, bzip2, flex, python, perl, make,
find, grep, diff, unzip, gawk, getopt, subversion, libz-dev and libc headers.

Run "./scripts/feeds update -a" to get all the latest package definitions
defined in feeds.conf / feeds.conf.default respectively
and "./scripts/feeds install -a" to install symlinks of all of them into
package/feeds/.

Use "make menuconfig" to configure your image.

Simply running "make" will build your firmware.
It will download all sources, build the cross-compile toolchain, 
the kernel and all choosen applications.

You can use "scripts/flashing/flash.sh" for remotely updating your embedded
system via tftp.

The OpenWrt system is documented in docs/. You will need a LaTeX distribution
and the tex4ht package to build the documentation. Type "make -C docs/" to build it.

To build your own firmware you need to have access to a Linux, BSD or MacOSX system
(case-sensitive filesystem required). Cygwin will not be supported because of
the lack of case sensitiveness in the file system.


Sunshine!
