Tenda W268R-related notes:
The system is very minimalized and doesnt follow normal
openwrt telnet + ssh system (with passwords),
so there's a few files (secrets) missing from the repo for a
functional image (atleast the host key and authorized keys):

package/base-files/files/etc/dropbear/authorized_keys
package/network/services/dropbear/files/dropbear_rsa_host_key
package/base-files/files/root/.ssh/id_dropbear
package/base-files/files/etc/config/wireless

also see
package/base-files/files/etc/config/network

It has a script to save files specified in 
/etc/cfg-saved-files (doesnt exist in image) to a 64k
mtd partition as cpio.gz for storing config
and a script thats run early on boot to restore them
(including the list of saved files that contains ref to itself).
If the WPS button is held during boot the restore is
skipped and the device has "factory" behaviour -
this is the only failsafe i have.

Updating FW is performed via script that uses scp 
to get the file from my pc and 
flashcp -v file /dev/mtd3 (IIRC, check yourself please)

Note on the role of the W268R for me (and the package selection):
- it's a relayd pseudobridge (bridge wlan->lan), with manually configured udhcpd serving
the lan because relayd dhcp bridging seems not to work (unknown why).
(way back it used to be an AP, but not now)

Note from 2017: Updated after that WPA2 breakage thing, might
be the last time i touch the W268R.
I was hoping for Designated Driver to be released and
get an official stable branch and i was thinking
of following that with the W268R patchset*, but then
LEDE and confusion happened... and I'm thinking of
moving away from the W268R as my wlan-lan-bridge
soon anyways. It might get more service in other
places though, so who knows.

* yeah I was super lazy when migrating to the
github openwrt tree (from openwrt.org git) and
just squished it into a single patch, so now
it's less of a patchset and more an awkward blobby thing,
it would require a lot of work to make it even look
like something (partially) upstreamable, so I'll
let it be what it is, and that is a stable and
relatively safe firmware for the W268R if you're
into putting a serial adapter inside it and
are happy twiddling with linux things

end of W268R notes

This is the buildsystem for the OpenWrt Linux distribution.

Please use "make menuconfig" to configure your appreciated
configuration for the toolchain and firmware.

You need to have installed gcc, binutils, bzip2, flex, python, perl, make,
find, grep, diff, unzip, gawk, getopt, subversion, libz-dev and libc headers.

Run "./scripts/feeds update -a" to get all the latest package definitions
defined in feeds.conf / feeds.conf.default respectively
and "./scripts/feeds install -a" to install symlinks of all of them into
package/feeds/.

Use "make menuconfig" to configure your image.

Simply running "make" will build your firmware.
It will download all sources, build the cross-compile toolchain, 
the kernel and all choosen applications.

You can use "scripts/flashing/flash.sh" for remotely updating your embedded
system via tftp.

The OpenWrt system is documented in docs/. You will need a LaTeX distribution
and the tex4ht package to build the documentation. Type "make -C docs/" to build it.

To build your own firmware you need to have access to a Linux, BSD or MacOSX system
(case-sensitive filesystem required). Cygwin will not be supported because of
the lack of case sensitiveness in the file system.


Sunshine!
